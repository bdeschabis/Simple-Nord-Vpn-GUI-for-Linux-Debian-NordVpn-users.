this is how the python application pip executable was built under linux Debian
1 - install pyinstaller, command: "pip3 install pyinstaller"
2 - find where it was installed, possibly in /home/---you---/.local/bin/pyinstaller
3 - in order to be able to launch the pyinstaller command without specifying the path, we copy pyinstaller in /usr/bin
4 - We go to the folder where the script nordvpn_Us.py is, and we type the command: pyinstaller nordvpn_Us.py --onefile --icon="nordvpn-choix-logo40_v.png"
    pyinstaller builds a Dist folder and a Build folder. 
    We find in the Dist folder the standalone program nordvpn_Us directly executable in a terminal (required)

application: create a launcher on your desktop, pointing to "nordvpn_Fr" , with icon "nordvpn-choix-logo40_v.png" , and marked for execution 
in a terminal (required). That's all.
